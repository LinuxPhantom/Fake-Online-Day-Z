## üíÄÔ∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions
**Issue**: The server won't start (infinite loop or no response).  
**Solution**: Ensure that the latest version of [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015-2022 (x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) is installed.

**Issue**: The mod stops working after a DayZ update.  
**Solution**: The update may have broken compatibility. Check for mod updates or remove the mod temporarily.

**Issue**: Player count is updated on Steam, but tools like RCon or Wargm don't show the change.  
**Solution**: This is expected behavior. The mod only affects the player count visible on Steam, not other monitoring tools.

## üíÄ Notes
- This **does not support pirated servers**.
- Fake player counts are only visible to users viewing the server through Steam.
- The does not interact with or modify actual player lists or gameplay.

## üíÄ Important

Most computer software license models have been written to prevent the
free distribution and/or modification of software. There are, however,
more liberal license models like GPL but even GPL sets some restrictions,

restrictions as to what the software can be done with.
